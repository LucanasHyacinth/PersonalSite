					So yeah Hya, Aya, Carmela, Carms (is fat – Abilay) is a 14-year old (dog with bangs – Asylla) fangirl.				    </p>
                    <p>She’s a fan of a lot of things and that includes oppas and kpop groups. 
					Ya-sho stans a lot of groups/artists as much as she can because she thinks they all deserve to be loved.<br>

                <div class="col-lg-4">
                  <p> But she's not just all about korean stuff, Ya-sho basically loves everything except for the things she doesnt. (Did that make sense? haha) A few of the things she also craves for are Japanese movies, Japanese actors, Japanese festivals that she often sees in the movies. (So much Japanese! ASIAN stuff are so good!) And Ya-sho's memories are what she loves the most. There's nothing a lot more important than that.</p>

                            <p> 1. January 14th: Diary Day/Candle Day <br>
                            <br>
                                Diaries are given to couples and friends as gifts. Anniversaries, birthdays and other special occasions are recorded into the journals. Also, some celebrate this day as “Candle Day” and give and receive decorative candles.<br>
                            <br>
                                2. February 14th: Valentine’s Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Valentine’s Day is celebrated in South Korea like it is everywhere else (in other countries). However there is a slight difference: Only the men get gifts, bummer right? But don’t worry ladies, your frown in going to turn into a smile in March<br>
                            <br>
                                3. March 14th: White Day<br>
                            <br>
                                On this day, it’s time for the men to do their part and give us lovely ladies gifts. Some follow the custom that the men should give women gifts that are 3 times the worth of what they received a month ago, ladies rule!<br>
                            <br>
                                4. April 14th: Black Day<br>
                            <br>
                                This holiday is mainly for single people. It’s rather a depressing day where single people eat a sticky, black-bean paste noodle dish called jjajangmyun (짜장면) and wish they had a love interest. However, some have turned the depressing day into a celebration where the single people celebrate their independence with noodles!<br>
                            <br>
                                5. May 14th: Yellow Day/Rose Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Yellow Day, couples dress in yellow and give each other roses. Singles that didn’t have their fill of lonely-heart noodles on Black Day have the chance to fill up on yellow curry and hope their love life will “spice up.”<br>
                            <br>
                                6. June 14th: Kiss Day<br>
                            <br>
                                This is a day to confess your feelings to a crush and start a new relationship with a smooch. Many companies, ranging from lipstick brands to breath mint makers, do their best to capitalize, offering special promotions.<br>
                            <br>
                                7. July 14th: Silver Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Couples exchange silver rings and discuss future plans of marriage. Acting as promise rings, the gifts are often given before or after in-person parental introductions.<br>
                            <br>
                                8. August 14th: Green Day<br>
                            <br>
                                This is a day designated for drinking soju (a harsh alcohol traditionally made from rice, tasting similar to vodka) and then taking a romantic walk in the woods. Most likely the brain child of a drunk teenager who wanted to be alone with his girlfriend, Green Day is centered around the fact that soju comes in a green bottle.<br>
                            <br>
                                9. September 14th: Photo Day/Music Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Most days in Korea are photo and music days, but the 14th of September is when it becomes “official” (or as official as an off-the-calendar holiday can get).<br>
                            <br>
                                Portrait studios and gimmick photo booths are popular, and it seems like everyone’s taking a reverse-facing camera shot. Noraebangs — singing (karaoke) rooms — are in high demand, as well.<br>
                            <br>
                                10. October 14th: Wine Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Couples drink a glass (or bottle) of wine over a romantic dinner. Singles drink away their sorrows.<br>
                            <br>
                                11. November 14th: Movie Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Movie theaters are jam-packed on this day, but couples also rent movies, give each other DVD gifts, or go to a DVD room (the “DVD Bang,” or movie room, is a popular Korean hangout on any day). They’re rented for approximately the price of one cinema ticket and can hold a small group of people. The DVDs are somewhat older than what’s playing in the theater, but not by much.<br>
                            <br>
                                12. December 14th: Hug Day<br>
                            <br>
                                Running short on reasons to dedicate a special day, Hug Day wraps up the year with a firm and gentle squeeze and a sigh of relief. Couples spend the day hugging each other, while polls on which Korean celebrity is most cuddle-worthy give the singles something to fantasize about. I think this holiday is really adorable!!<br>
                            <br>

                            <h2>BTS Imagine: One Last Time</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
                            <img src="img/portfolio/onelastime.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>Months have passed ever since we broke up. Time really does fly fast. 
							I went to my seat and heard Jungkook’s close friends teasing him. 
							Suddenly, Jimin told him “Go take Y/N to prom”. I froze. “Wow Jimin, nice JOKE.” I said in my head. 
							“I’m not joking.” Jimin said as if hearing my inside thoughts. I looked over at him, then at Jungkook. 
							We caught each other’s eyes and avoided them after a second. Jungkook stood up and got out of the room. 
							Jimin looked disappointed but as soon as he saw me looking at him, he smiled. “I can’t believe you said that.” 
							I told him and sat on my desk. “I can’t believe you’re still as different to the other girls as ever. 
							Sitting on desks, being strong.. I still like that, you know.” His voice got low at the end of what he said. 
							“Jimin, you know I can’t–” I stood up, went nearer to him but he cut the sentence. 
							“I know. Okay. Fine. I’m sorry.” He lowered his said and sat down then slowly, his face was burried on the table. 
							I went back to my seat for the last subject which’s Physics. 
							One of my faves because of the teacher, Sir Kim, who was really good at handling classes and never bored me. 
							I was a bit concerned about Jimin though, he was busy texting, probably, Jungkook for missing class.<br>
							<br>
                             When the class ended, I went to the locker room and tried (key word: TRIED) to organize my locker. 
							 As I was about to close it, I noticed a small note taped to the bottom. 
							 “Prom? -JK” I looked around hoping he was still there which was unlikely. 
							 “Seriously? This is your way of asking me?” I thought to myself. My phone rang and I answered the call. 
							 It was my sister telling me to hurry up to her place already. 
							 While I was on my way, I met Jimin who said “Good luck” and Namjoon who smiled at me. 
							 It was kind of weird to get a good luck, to be honest. 
							 I shrugged it off and hurried to my sister’s studio which was located at the 2nd floor of her big house. 
							 It’s where she produced music and also taught some chosen people how. “Eonnieee.” I called her. 
							 She opened the studio’s door but it was only enough for me to see her and not the rest of the room. 
							 Maybe she had a guest? I noticed a familiar voice but maybe I was just imagining it. “Your new dress is in my room.” 
							 She told me and– wait what? “Eonnie, what do you mean NEW?” I asked her. 
							 But she just pushed me and told me to go and check it out. 
							 I knew it was tiring if I fought her so I just went to her room for the dress and I saw it lying on her bed. 
							 It’s elegant. Black and mocha looked really good together. After imagining myself wearing it, I saw a note on the floor. 
							 “Wear this.” It said and the handwriting is similar to.. That’s improbable. 
							 Why do I keep imagining things? This isn’t from him.. I think?<br>
							 <Br>
							 Just a few more minutes and prom was about to start. And 2 days ago, I had sudden interactions with Jungkook. 
							 But it felt like it was just awhile ago as I saw him walk up to me. Everyone was staring. 
							 I realized we wore matching outfits and he looked attractive. 
							 He gave me that sweet and sexy smile which makes girls fall for him deeper and I couldn’t help but give him a smile, too, in return. 
							 He whispered to my ears “Nice dress, princess.” with a chuckle and gave me a kiss on the cheeks as a way of greeting. 
							 I can feel the other girls blushing and screaming internally but I tried to keep myself from getting all red. 
							 I did great with that although I had to tell myself “Be cool. Be cool.” every other minute. 
							 The students were seated with their pairs and the promenade has started. 
							 The host, which was Jin and a Student Council official, started the event with greetings and an opening speech by the former Student Council President, Namjoon, 
							 since the present one was not able to join the party. And then video presentations were shown for the school’s Promenade traditions. 
							 Then dinner. “YES, FINALLY.” I whispered to myself. I heard JK chuckle so I looked at him and tried to look mad but he chuckled again and I pouted.
							 “Don’t do that. I might kiss you..” he said in a REALLY attractive way that I almost (key word: ALMOST) told him it’s okay if he’d kiss me. 
							 I avoided his look because I knew I’d be getting red a few seconds after. We were served dinner and he was freaking cute (I SWEAR) when he ate. 
							 “Jungkook.” Alicia, the school flirt who was sitting in the same table as us, called him. 
							 “You have something.. in your um near your mouth.” She said. I looked at him and indeed there was.. spaghetti sauce. 
							 I wanted to laugh at him a bit but then I noticed Alicia getting a tissue to wipe JK’s mouth. 
							 But before she could do it, I smoothly snatched the tissue from her and said “Thanks, Alicia. 
							 Very kind of you to hand his girlfriend a tissue.” Then I wiped Jungkook’s mouth. 
							 Jungkook grinned and told me “Thanks, love.” (Key word: LOVE) with a wink. “In your ugly face, bitch.” I thought to myself. 
							 Alicia looked annoyed. And I probably was blushing. I mean.. I called myself HIS GIRL and he called me LOVE. 
							 Phrases like “oh my gawwdd my hearteu.” was floating in my mind and every time I thought of it, my heart beat faster.<br>
							 <br>
							 It was time for the dance. Boys asked me for a dance and girls who were really confident asked JK. 
							 But Jungkook didn’t even ask me, how could he enjoy himself now? When I finished dancing waltz with Namjoon, 
							 he told me to send his regards to my sister because they were pretty close. 
							 Taehyung and I danced and I was glad the music played meant we were gonna dance foxtrot. 
							 Taehyung dances well but I loved seeing him dance foxtrot. I danced the same with Hoseok who was the brother of my bestfriend. 
							 He got along well with my sister too. So we were basically like siblings. Then a few songs after, Jimin asked me to do tango with him. 
							 I knew Jimin was also great so I said yes. And inside, I was really waiting for Jungkook to ask me for a dance. 
							 People told us we looked sexy and great when we danced tango. Jimin gave a grin and all the girls were probably jealous I got to dance with him. 
							 I wasn’t able to keep in track on how many songs have passed but JK still has not asked me for a dance.<br>
							 <br>
							 The hosts told us to take our seats for the announcement of the new members of the prom’s royal family. 
							 First one was the Faces of the Night which were obviously Jin and Chesca. Then they announced the Prom Prince and Princess who were Jimin and Mika. 
							 “YASSS.” I said inside my weird head. Jungkook and the other students cheered too. 
							 It was also exciting to know who the new King and Queen was– Yoonji and Taehyung. 
							 I laughed when Yoonji rejected the Queen’s crown and had the King’s instead. 
							 Taehyung then had to wear the Queen’s which I think was really cute and funny. 
							 After that, the Best Couple was announced and the winners totally surprised me. Jungkook was even ‘shookt’ for a second. 
							 But then he stood up and held my hand. We walked up the stage with the other winners who were just our close friends. 
							 The photographer told us to pose and when he clicked, Jungkook kissed my cheek. 
							 Most students were cheering and asked us to do one more.<br>
							<br>
							We went back to our seats and then each class went up the stage to take a picture together. 
							And when everyone got their turn, it was time for the last part of prom. The last dance. 
							I saw Jimin with Mika and dancing beside them was Taetae and Ariesa. 
							While my eyes were searching through the crowd for JK, I saw Yoongi holding a drink with Julie and his sister, Yoonji, 
							was talking with Jin and Chesca near the dessert table. And then there was Hoseok trying to get away from the silly mascot. 
							“Dance?” Jungkook offered his hand to me. I slapped it and crossed my arms. “After you kept me waiting? No.” I said. 
							Alicia was about to take his hand so I acted fast and “On a second thought.” then I gave both her and JK a wink.<br>
							<br>
							While we were dancing, “Y/N..” he whispered. “Kookie..” I whispered back. Before he could say anything else, I told him everything. 
							“I’m sorry. I am sorry for the misunderstandings and wanting to hold you back. I was too selfish. 
							And I am really sorry for that, JK.. But now, I want you to know that I am fine and you should be happy and debut as an idol. 
							I understand you a lot more now that I also have stepped forward to reach my dream. 
							I know.. after this, it will be kind of a long time before we can be together again. 
							But I will support you in any way that I can. I promise that.” I finally told him. I felt all the weight in my heart evaporate. 
							I was satisfied and happy with what I’ve decided. Without saying anything else, he said “Thank you..” 
							I smiled and looked at his eyes which were already staring at me. 
							Before I realized we had already stopped dancing and most of the students were seated already.. he kissed me. “Thank you, Y/N.”<br>
							<br>
							The moment I woke up, my phone vibrated. “Everything’s ready! I organized them all already
							So just take your time and get pretty! Because we are about to receive the award for all of our hard work.” A text from Ariesa. 
							And then I checked my inbox which was full of text messages from my best friends and some were from my sister, Yoonji and the others. 
							An unknown number texted me. It said “Congrats Y/N! I surely will be able to visit your gallery tonight. 
							\Can’t wait to see you and the others. -PJMN” I was glad to receive a text from this person. 
							After all the years we have not seen each other, I was excited to see him again. 
							I heard Jungkook debuted with his best friends in a soon-to-be-LEGENDARY group but I have not heard from him. 
							I was busy travelling to every part of the world anyway. Volunteering to help people and animals of every kind was my hobby. 
							And my job? Painting. I drew every single special memory I ever had from each country. 
							Like taking care of a penguin for 2 months when it was severely wounded. 
							Also, when the team and I camped out and I made a friend which was a fox who loved my tent very much. 
							I named him Vick and although I was a bit scared sometimes, I loved him.<br>
							<br>
							I got ready for the gallery which will be composed of my paintings, Julie’s photographs and Mika’s fashion show with a special guest, 
							Chesca, who was already famous worldwide as an actress and singer. 
							All of us succeeded which made me happy with the thought that our efforts were not put into the trash can. 
							When I arrived at the venue, I found myself looking around and waiting for Jimin and our close friends. 
							The event started but I have not seen them yet. 
							My best friends and I proceeded with the program and greeted the important visitors with admiration and respect. 
							I went to my part of the gallery and saw Hoseok and then Namjoon who was with my sister. 
							I was really happy seeing both of them together again and Hoseok looked amused with the paintings. 
							Then a few minutes later, Mika’s fashion show started and I was seated at the front. 
							Julie was everywhere, trying to take the best pictures. Also in the front seats were Jin, Ariesa and Taehyung. 
							I got up to go nearer to them but a visitor accidentally spilled wine on my dress. 
							She apologized and I hurried to the bathroom. I saw Yoonji standing with a bottle of wine. “You never changed.” 
							I told her and she chuckled a bit. “Here, wear this.” She handed me a paper bag and went out with a smile. 
							I checked what was inside and it was a dress.. the dress I wore for prom. I had no choice, I guess? 
							So I changed and arrived at the show which was ending. I walked to Ariesa and my best friends who were with the guests. 
							They congratulated us for doing such an amazing gallery and gave us great ratings and comments.<br>
							<br>
							There was still one more part of the gallery that I was not able to take a look at– photographs. 
							When I went there minutes ago, it was full of people. But the number has died down a bit now. Julie’s pictures entertained me. 
							Photographs are a bit similar to paintings, you know. The only difference is that you use a camera in one and a brush with the other. 
							I walked and walked.. and met Jimin. He was looking at the photographs and it seemed like he felt all the feelings of that one single photograph. 
							It was a picture of a girl who was looking up the sky from her window and a boy who was looking at her from another window. 
							When he turned around, he looked kind of shocked to see me and then he laughed. “Long time no see.” He pinched my cheeks. 
							We did not talk long but he told me we’d be seeing each other soon after this. He waved goodbye and I continued walking. 
							“Damn, I miss that guy.” I thought to myself as Jimin left. And then I saw one picture that hooked me. The picture..<br>
							<br>
							It was us. Jungkook and I dancing in prom. I went nearer to it. I felt my tears fall down and seconds after, someone hugged me from the back. 
							“Nice dress, princess.” And kissed my cheeks. I turned around. “Kookie..” I whispered. 
							“What was the theme of that prom again?” He asked me with a smile plastered on his face. “One last time.” 
							I remembered and told him. “One last time?” He asked me seriously. “Yes, one last time.”
							I replied. He held my hands and said “Thank you, Y/N.” Then he moved his hands to my face and kissed me on my forehead.<br>
							<br>

                            <p>Today, I’m gonna be honest<br>
							<br>
                            Lets start with your hair<br>
							<br>
                            It’s not silky<br>
							<br>
                            Nor as black as ebony<br>
							<br>
                            It is just there<br>
							<br>
                            To make you look human<br>
							<br>
                            And I don’t really find<br>
							<br>
                            It that nice<br>
							<br>
                            Now with your eyes,<br>
							<br>
                            The only reason why<br>
							<br>
                            I call them pretty<br>
							<br>
                            Is because I see me<br>
							<br>
                            My reflection, my beauty<br>
							<br>
                            And not because I feel<br>
							<br>
                            That its sent from above<br>
							<br>
                            God,<br>
							<br>
                            Those eyes look so sad, <br>
							<br>
                            My love<br>
							<br>
                            Then your lips<br>
							<br>
                            It’s so dry<br>
							<br>
                            Maybe that’s why<br>
							<br>
                            You’re thirsty<br>
							<br>
                            Too thirsty that it made me think<br>
							<br>
                            You were dry land<br>
							<br>
                            Wanting the whole ocean<br>
							<br>
                            And I was water in a cactus<br>
							<br>
                            In the palace of the king<br>
							<br>
                            Of the sun and the sand<br>
							<br>
                            And I just cant.<br>
							<br>
                            Still, I will be honest<br>
							<br>
                            Even when that sinful organ<br>
							<br>
                            In your chest<br>
							<br>
                            Is gonna bleed<br>
							<br>
                            I will still be honest<br>
							<br>
                            And tell you how it feels<br>
							<br>
                            To hate someone you cant believe<br>
							<br>
                            You loved before<br>
							<br>
                            You called me a liar<br>
							<br>
                            When I told you, you were<br>
							<br>
                            An artwork whose beauty<br>
							<br>
                            Was far more<br>
							<br>
                            Than Da Vinci’s and Van Gogh’s paintings<br>
							<br>
                            You shine brighter<br>
							<br>
                            Than the starry starry night<br>
							<br>
                            And you leave a larger<br>
							<br>
                            Mark of history with just one look<br>
							<br>
                            At someone’s eye<br>
							<br>
                            But you thought it was all lies<br>
							<br>
                            You always called me a liar<br>
							<br>
                            When you know it’s not true<br>
							<br>
                            So I’m gonna be honest with you<br>
							<br>
                            You’re an imperfect little bitch<br>
							<br>
                            Who can’t appreciate the things that I did<br>
							<br>
                            Maybe you just don’t know how<br>
							<br>
                            But am I honest enough now?<br>

                            just another story someday."<br>

                            Now here's a poem from my drafts<br>
                            that I have been wanting to share for quite a while now.<br>
                            <br>
                            Here's to sad songs<br>
                            Played in the dark<br>
                            For the missed calls<br>
                            And broken hearts<br>
                            Here's to tear stained pillows<br>
                            Every sleepless nights<br>
                            I just miss the you<br>
                            That stayed by my side<br>
                            Here's to rotten roses<br>
                            And getting rid of them<br>
                            Along our memories<br>
                            Which were once gems<br>
                            Here's to the girl<br>
                            Who's still alive<br>
                            Despite the assholes<br>
                            That ruined her life<br>
                            Here's to the boy<br>
                            Who keeps moving on<br>
                            Despite the bitches<br>
                            That left him alone<br>
                            Here's to all<br>
                            Here's to who's here<br>
                            That loves to fall<br>
                            And loves to tear<br>
                            <br>
                            --<br>
